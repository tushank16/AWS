## EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Amazon E2C

It is a computer system which is mamaged remotly and we can access it remotly from anywhere.
It works on pay-as-you-use strategy.
Amazon has created data centers all accross the world from where you an access it.
The data center is the one where the computers are stored.
We can choose different computing power like the PROCESSOR, RAM, ROM(Volume) and OS and we will be chared based upon the amount of data used. we are also provided with High speed internet.and once our use is over we can switch off the machine and no amt will be charged.
The Volume used Will only be charged in that switch off mode.
we can also upscale and downscale the processing power as per our requirement if for a certain period of time we require more RAM for better speed we can do it in minutes and againafter the use we can switch back to previous at any given time.

# Advantages of EC2:-

- Better flexibility of resources(Procssor, RAM,ROM)
- NO worry of maintaing the Computer( AWS will take care of)
- Faster internet
- Charged as per the Resourced Used for that amount of time
